History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old male with a history of depression who was
admitted on [**1-2**] after an apparent intentional overdose of
Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin and found down with dried blood
along his lips. Due to somnolence and poor gag reflex, he was
intubated and admitted to the ICU. NG lavage was performed and
revealed coffee grounds. GI was consulted and he received IV
PPI, and one unit of pRBCs. They perfomed upper endoscopy which
showed gastritis, no evidence of active bleeding, and pill
fragments (some of which could be collected). Per toxicology,
serial aspirin levels were checked with a max of 38. He was
given IVFs with bicarb, and actived charcoal on [**1-3**]. There was
some concern re: serotonin syndrome but with no symptoms of this
and nl QT intervals on serial EKGs. He was treated for a likely
aspiratin pneumonia with Unasyn, transitioned to Augmentin, was
extubated and is now satting well on room air. He has been
treated for renal failure which is resolving. CKs elevated but
are now downtrending. Psychiatry has been following and
recommended continuing to hold Paxil and inpatient psych
admission. Section 12 was signed.

Past Medical History:
- Depression
- HTN
- History of colonic polyps
- Hematuria

Social History:
Lives with daughter who recently returned from living abroad.
She has pain disorder - this and her resulting behavior in the
setting of financial issues have caused distress at home within
the family.  Non-smoker with occasional glass of wine per family
and prior records. The patient was born in [**State 531**]. Both of his
parents are deceased.  He has one brother who lives in [**Name (NI) **].
The patient has a PhD in psychology and has been teaching
religion and [**Hospital1 100**] Studies for the last 30 years.  He recently
decided to take the next semester off from teaching because of
decreased ability to concentrate and his worries about his
financial situation.  He is married and has two sons and one
daughter.

.
ECG [**2108-1-2**]:  Sinus tachycardia. Prominent inferior lead Q waves
raise the consideration of prior inferior myocardial infarction
although are non-diagnostic. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities are
non-specific. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
ECG [**2108-1-3**]:  Sinus rhythm. Early precordial QRS transition.
Modest inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Findings are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of same date there is
probably no significant change.
.
Chest radiograph [**2108-1-2**]:  FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal
tube is 4.4 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses
through the esophagus, enters into the stomach, but extends off
the field of view of this image. Lung volumes are low. No focal
consolidations are present. The left costophrenic angle was
excluded from view of this image. The cardiac silhouette, hilar
and mediastinal contours appear normal. The aorta is slightly
tortuous.
IMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are
low without
evidence for focal consolidation.
.
CT head without contrast [**2108-1-3**]:  FINDINGS: There is no
hemorrhage, Edema, mass effect, or evidence for acute vascular
territorial infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
appears well preserved. In the region of the left basal ganglia
is a prominent CSF space (2:11). There is moderate mucosal
thickening with air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus
and bilateral ethmoid air cells. The frontal sinuses, sphenoid
sinuses, and mastoid air cells are clear. Middle ear cavity is
clear. The globes and orbits are intact. There are no fractures.
Rounded hyperdensity along the posterior medial region of the
inferior bony orbit (2:5) on axial images is not substantiated
on coronal reformatted images and likely represents volume
averaging with the orbital bone and inferior rectus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Moderate right maxillary and ethmoid sinus opacification.
.
Chest radiography [**2108-1-4**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the
study of [**1-3**], the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been
removed. The right base is now essentially clear, and there is
no convincing evidence of aspiration.
.
Chest radiography [**2108-1-6**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-3**] and 13.
Mild relative congestion in the right lung could be due to early
edema in the site of previous aspiration, but does not suggest
pneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tiny left
pleural effusion is seen only on the lateral view. Heart size
normal. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 year old male with a past medical history of
depression who was admitted status post suicide attempt with
overdose ingestion of Seroquel, Paxil, and aspirin.  Status post
3 day course in the MICU.  Now doing well on the floor and as of
[**2108-1-7**], medically stable for transfer to psychiatric unit for
further management of acute on chronic depression.
.
Suicidal Ingestion: Mr. [**Known lastname 84199**] was admitted after ingesting a
large number of aspirin tablets, Seroquel and Paxil. This was
confirmed by toxicology and EGD. NGT was placed, activated
charcoal administered, and bicarb gtt was started. EKG and ABGs
were followed serially. Made NPO and started on IV pantoprazole.
EGD revealed a large number of intact aspirin tablets in the
antrum of his stomach, which were removed. ASA known to cause
spasm of the pylorus, so gastric emptying may have been slowed.
Erosions had appeared - a likely cause of hematemesis at
presetation. ASA continued to rise early in the admission with a
peak of 38, which fell to 11 prior to transfer to the general
medicine floor. Bicarbonate was given for resulting acidosis. A
marked anion gap was never present. In regards to paxil and
seroquel, patient was monitored closely for extrapyramidal
symptoms and for serotonin syndrome but none were found.
Medically stable for transfer to psychiatric floor.
.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia: Secondary to gastritis from pill
ingestion, as evidenced by EGD.  Required 1 unit PRBC
transfusion but hematocrits were measured serially and have been
stable upon reaching the general medicine floor.  IV PPI was
initially administered and was transitioned to PO.  Lisinopril
and nifedipine was restarted and uptitrated to home dose with
stable blood pressures.
.
Depression and Suicidality: Patient is status post suicide
attempt with overdose of seroquel, paxil, and aspirin.  Familial
predisposition may have played some role.  He will likely
benefit more from combined therapy and medication.
Anti-depressive/anxiety medications were held in the context of
having received an enormous dose.  Was placed on 1:1 sitter.
Consulted by social work and psychiatry teams.  Will likely
reinitiate antidepressant treatment upon transfer to psychiatric
unit.  Patient is medically stable as of [**2108-1-7**] and will
require transfer to psychiatric inpatient facility for further
management of psychiatric issues.
.
Aspiration Pneumonia: Chemical lung injury suspected on basis of
clear aspiration of blood and stomach contents.  Due to question
of pneumonia on chest radiograph, was started on Unasyn and
transitioned to Augmentin in the MICU.  Was found to develop low
grade fevers upon reaching the general medicine floor, with
negative culture data.  Due to question of drug fever (and
documented allergy to amoxicillin), patient was transitioned to
levaquin.  Intermittent low grade fevers are likely secondary to
resolving URI.  Medically stable for transfer to psychiatry.
.
Acute Renal Failure: Peaked to high of 1.9.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
multifactorial, with urine lytes nondiagnostic.  Brief period of
hypotension, aspirin ingestion, and elevation of CK associated
with rhabdomyolysis may have all contributed to kidney damage.
Was given IV hydration with normalization of creatinine.
.
Rhabdomyolysis: Patient found on the floor for unclear duration.
 Likely muscle breakdown with CK rising to [**2003**].  CK values at
the time of discharge were within normal limits.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].  You were admitted to the hospital after
ingesting paxil, seroquel, and aspirin.  You were sent to the
ICU and a tube was placed in your mouth to protect your
breathing.  You also were found to have some signs of bleeding,
and required scoping procedures from the gastroenterology
(stomach) doctors which showed [**Name5 (PTitle) 84200**] of your stomach but
no active sources of bleeding.  You were given medications to
help clear your ingested pills from your body.  You now have a
possible pneumonia in your lungs, but are doing well with
antibiotics.  Due to your depression, you are being transferred
to a psychiatric inpatient unit to further monitor your
progress.
